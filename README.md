#### What does this do?
This extension appends a "Run With PRIME" option to the right click menu on applications in the GNOME dash.
This extension allows desktop-level integration avoiding the use of the command line to use the GPU on demand.

#### What is needed for this to work?
To configure your X Server to work with this, follow this nVidia guide: https://download.nvidia.com/XFree86/Linux-x86_64/435.17/README/primerenderoffload.html
